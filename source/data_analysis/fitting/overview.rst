Regression and Curve Fitting
============================
Curve fitting is the process of determining the curve that best fits the experimental data. The result of a regression analysis is usually used to fit a curve to the experimental data, and the terms "regression analysis" and "curve fitting" are often used interchangeably. More specifically, curve fitting can also be accomplished using interpolation and smoothing techniques, which are also supported in LabPlot and are discussed in other sections.

LabPlot uses the nonlinear least-squares method and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms to estimate the unknown parameters, see "Mathematical Background" for more details. It is possible to perform weighted fits as well as to apply bounds on the fit parameters. The calculated fit functions can be evaluated outside of the specified data range used for the fit allowing extrapolation beyond the experimental data. Various built-in fit models are available.
