Templates
===================

A common use-case for the usage of ``templates`` is for example the situation where the appearance of a curve with a certain set of properties for the symbol type and size, line width, colors, etc. needs to be applied on other curves in the same or in other projects in a quick way. For this, the current settings are saved in a template and loaded for other objects of interest.

Similarly, the current properties of the object can be saved as the ``default properties`` ("default template") that will be automatically applied for every new object of this type.

The management of templates is done via the template bar at the bottom of the :ref:`interface_properties_explorer` hosting the three buttons to save the current properties as a template, to load the properties from a list of saved templates and to save the current properties as the new default ones.
