Data Analysis and Statistics
--------------------------------

- Column statistics spreadsheet – child spreadsheet showing various statistical properties of the parent spreadsheet

- Maximum Likelihood estimation for fitting statistical distributions like Gaussian Poisson, Exponential, Laplace, Binomial, Cauchy-Lorentz and more
- Baseline subtraction (background correction) with the asymmetrically re-weighted penalized least squares (arPLS) algorithm
- Data reduction by removing data points using multiple algorithms (Douglas-Peucker, Visvalingam-Whyatt, Reumann-Witkam, Opheim, Lang and other algorithms)
- Numerical differentiation (up to the 6th order) and numerical integration (rectangular, trapezoid and Simpson methods)
- Smoothing of data with moving average, Savitzky-Golay and percentile filter methods
- Interpolation of data, support for many methods (linear, polynomial, splines, piecewise cubic Hermite polynomial, etc.)
- Fourier transform of the input data with support for many different window functions (Welch, Hann, Hamming, Blackman, etc.)
- Fourier Filter – low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-reject filters of different types (Butterworth, Chebyshev I+II, Legendre, Bessel-Thomson)
- Hilbert Transform including envelope
- Convolution and de-convolution of data sets (sampling interval, linear/circular, normalization, wrap, standard kernel)
- Auto-correlation and cross-correlation of data sets (sampling interval, linear/circular, normalization)
- Quick statistical previews available in spreadsheets that consist of multiple location, dispersion and shape measures for quantitative and categorical data and statistical plots like histograms, KDE plots, Q-Q plots, box plots, Pareto plot
- Extensive parser for mathematical expressions supporting a great number of functions and constants used for data generation in spreadsheets and further data analysis and visualization

Computational Notebooks
------------------------

- An interactive and animated front-end to powerful mathematics and statistics packages and programming languages like Maxima, Octave, R, Scilab, Sage, KAlgebra, Qalculate!, Python, Julia, Lua
- Support for using multiple notebooks and languages at the same time
- Notebook variables holding array-like data (Maxima lists, Python lists and tuples, etc.) can be used as the source for interactive plots
- Ability to show variable statistics and to plot data from the context menu in the project explorer for variables created in a Notebook
- Extensive edition capability
- Support for plotting
