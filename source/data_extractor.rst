Data Extractor
=========================

``Data Extractor`` is a tool that allows to easily extract data from image files. The process of extraction consists mainly out of the following steps:

- Import an image containing plots and curves where you want to read the data points from

- Select the plot type (Cartesian, polar, etc.)

- Select tree reference points and provide values for them. With the help of these points, the logical coordinate system is determined

- Create a new Data Extractor curve and set the type of error bars.

- Switch to the mouse mode ``Set Curve Point`` and start selecting points on the imported image - the coordinates for the selected points are determined and added to the spreadsheet "Data".

.. note::

   The Data Extractor is a renamed version of Data Picker.
